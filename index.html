    <p>
	My name is Xena, I live in Chicago, IL, and I like to play soccer, videogames, and read Harry Potter. I also have an alias, but it is not to be disclosed online.. I have coded a website, called <a href="https://skoobooks.paperplane.io">Skoobooks</a>.

<p><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong> 1st place in Science Olympiad Invitational, 2nd place in Science Olympiad Reigonals. Noetic Honor Roll.</p>
    <p>The website I would like to build is called <strong><em>Brain Games</em></strong>. This website would have many pages, each containing a game/puzzle. Playing these games would help you improve focus. You could train specific parts of your brain. That's why I want to build this website.
